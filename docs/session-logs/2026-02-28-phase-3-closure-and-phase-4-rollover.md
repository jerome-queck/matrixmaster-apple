## Focus
Close Phase 3 documentation and schedule remaining non-blocking follow-ups into explicit Phase 4 checkpoints.

## Work completed
- Marked Phase 3 as complete in status docs and noted Phase 4 as next.
- Updated roadmap follow-up wording so deferred items are explicitly scheduled instead of appearing as unresolved Phase 3 blockers.
- Updated feature matrix labels for deferred theory/UX spaces rows so they no longer read as unfinished Phase 3 scope.
- Added backlog carry-over section with explicit scheduling:
  - Phase 4 checkpoint 1: coordinate-family diagnostics polish and math typography baseline
  - Phase 4 checkpoint 2+: abstract-space presets (polynomial/matrix templates)
- Added this closure task/session record for traceable phase handoff.

## Tests run
- No executable code changes in this closure task (documentation-only updates).

## Docs updated
- `docs/START_HERE.md`
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md`
- `docs/FEATURE_MATRIX.md`
- `docs/FEATURE_BACKLOG.md`
- `docs/tasks/TASK-0011-milestone-c-spaces-composition-workflows.md`
- `docs/session-logs/2026-02-28-milestone-c-spaces-composition-workflows.md`
- `docs/tasks/TASK-0012-phase-3-closure-and-phase-4-rollover.md`
- `docs/session-logs/2026-02-28-phase-3-closure-and-phase-4-rollover.md`

## Risks / open questions
- Phase 4 planning should preserve checkpoint discipline so carry-over polish does not delay linear-map core workflows.
- Math typography scope should remain baseline-focused in checkpoint 1 to avoid broad UI refactor churn.

## Next recommended step
Start Phase 4 checkpoint 1 implementation (linear maps + scheduled carry-over polish) using this closure state as the baseline.
